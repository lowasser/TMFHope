\name{\cXO{}}

You are \cXO{}. You served in \TMN{} for several years alongside \cCap{}. The two of you made a great complement. \cCap{} was the calm and patient sort, and you have never hesitated to raise your voice to get the crew to hop to. \cCap{} and you were very close in Officer's Academy, so when the war broke out, things got very awkward for you very quickly. Your family were \pEdge{}, and \cCap{} was from \pHome{}. Your family demanded you prove your loyalty by preventing the \pOld{} from receiving the summons to \pBattle{}. Reluctantly you sabotaged the \pOld{} com system, and delayed it's repair for as long as you could. With the hours delay, \pOld{} was in no position to help when she jumped in over \pHome{}, but \cCap{} sent everyone to battle stations and waded in anyway. You knew you were going to die on that suicide mission. But something happened - suddenly the bridge of the \pOld{} was filled with choking smoke. Then it was gone. From that moment on, the \pOld{} and her crew could do no wrong in that battle. You did the impossible that day.

The few survivors of your family were furious, but with the back of the \pEdge{} broken, they could do nothing more than forbid you to take the fall for \cCap{}. \cCap{\They} were given a dishonorable discharge, and you lost track of \cCap{\them} for a few years. When \cCap{\they} resurfaced, and asked you for help getting a civilian command, you jumped at the chance. You helped \cCap{} acquire the \pNew{}. Then, tired of your family's meddling, quit the Navy and signed on as \cCap{}'s XO. You never wanted to  betray them, but betray you did, and you shudder to think what would happen if \cCap{} ever found out.

As you helped \cCap{} assemble a crew for the \pNew{}, an old, familiar name came up for the Science Officer. You went to college with \cSci{} before joining the Officers Academy. The two of you had a powerful romance, and it broke both of your hearts when you family ordered you to the Academy. You tried to tell yourself that it was years ago, and that \cSci{} had probably moved on. You tried to tell yourself that it would be against regulation to try to regain what the two of you had. You tried to tell \cCap{} that \cSci{} wasn't the best candidate. None of it worked. Within a week of \cSci{} joining the crew, the two of you were stealing time alone whenever you could. Yet another secret to desperately try to not get caught for.

Not everyone on the crew is an old friend. \cDip{} is an old family enemy. \cDip{\They} used to be a spy - you aren't sure that \cDip{\they} aren't still a spy. They were a spy for \pPlan{} before and during the war. And somewhere in all of that they claim to have ferreted out what you did to \cCap{}. They hold that blackmail over you, gloating whenever the two of you are alone. So far they haven't asked you to do anything in exchange for their silence, but how long will that last? You've got to do something.

As you wake in the Science Lab, everything has a cyan tint.  As the XO, it is your job to support the Captain, protect the crew, repair the ship, and get home. The middle of a crisis isn't a great time to find out that someone isn't up to the stress of space travel, but you never really know someone's true ability unti they are put under pressure. You intend to keep a close eye on the crew for your report afterwards. You plan to reward extraordinary effort, and be honest about any shortcomings. Your report could start or end a career for a crewmember.

\begin{itemz}[Goals]
	\item Protect and support \cSci{}, and definitely don't let anyone find out about your relationship. It's a dismissible offense for you, and could ruin \cSci{\their} career.
	\item Find out who caused the botched Jump - honestly, it was probably \cDip{}. They've got it in for you. You don't trust \pPlan{} justice though - it's best if you deal with them here and now.
	\item Protect the rest of the crew from the saboteur, whoever they are.
	\item Deal with \cDip{} somehow. Find blackmail on them, neutralize what they've got on you, make sure they don't survive this, or something. Enough is enough, you didn't escape your family just to be under this jerk's control.
	\item Not your highest priority, but it is generally the XO's job to evaluate the crew for general fitness. A crisis like this demonstrates exactly why everyone must be able to perform at their best. If you find out that anyone isn't able to perform their functions, you will have to decide if you report them and probably end their career, or keep quiet, and put this crew and whoever they may work with in the future in danger.
	
\end{itemz}

\begin{itemz}[Notes]
	\item You start in the Science Lab in the ``Cyan'' Dimension. You also have access to the Cafeteria in the ``Blue'' Dimension. 
	\item You know that the \pNew{} has very limited supplies for repairing the ship or any unorthodox operations to try to reverse whatever happened. It is vital that you get a full inventory of what damages the ship has sustained, what will be required to repair it, and establish a plan, \emph{before} anyone starts trying to repair anything.
\end{itemz}

\begin{contacts}
	\contact{\cCap{}} You regret betraying \cCap{} every day of your life.
	\contact{\cSci{}} You first met \cSci{} in college, before going to officers school. You had a romance then that you have rekindled on the \pNew{}. It is, of course, against regulation, and you would be in a lot of trouble if anyone found out.
	\contact{\cDip{}} Nosy pain in the neck, \cDip{} claims to know what you did during the war between the \pPlan{} and \pEdge{}. You hate being blackmailed like this.
