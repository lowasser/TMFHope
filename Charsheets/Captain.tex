\name{\cCap{}}

Your name is \cCap{}. You were Their Majesty's Navy's rising star, until \pBattle{}. You were captain of The TMF Phoenix, one of the Navy's best strike ships. \cXO{} was your second in command. When the call to arms went out, somehow the TMF Phoenix didn't receive the call for hours. By the time you jumped in, the battle was lost - or so any tactician would have said. You were no quitter though, and that was your home planet below, so the TMF Phoenix went to battle stations and waded in. The Phoenix was out-matched; the move was suicide. But you had a secret weapon. You pulled a medallion from around your neck - an old family heirloom, and smashed it on the floor of the Bridge. Smoke poured from the broken bits of glass and metal, and a voice of something ancient and malevolent spoke to you. You begged for the power to turn the tide of battle and save your planet. The entity agreed, and vanished. You never learned the price of your boon.

THe TMF Phoenix \emph{did} carry the day. You scrapped a miraculous win. Despite this, your superiors were obligated to issue a dishonorable discharge for your failure to answer the summons in a timely manner. You spiraled out for a while - your family had been in the Navy for generations. Your Mother, her father, his mother, numerous aunts and uncles\ldots you get the picture. You drifted from station to station, directionless. One night you got into a fight over a game of cards, and the bastard drew a knife. If it weren't for \cMed{}, you might have died in that back room. But they patched you up, whether you deserved it or not. You owe \cMed{} your life.

A brush with death like that will set even the hardest \cCap{\human} straight. You began to pick up the pieces of your life. You reached out to \cXO{}, who had told you when you were discharged that if you ever needed anything\ldots. You'd never command another military ship, but plenty of merchant craft needed captains. \cXO{} helped you secure one, and then to your amazement, quit their position in the Navy, and came to serve on your crew. \cMed{}, who you'd been keeping in touch with was also surprisingly happy to leave their station-side post to join up.
