\name{\cCap{}}

Your name is \cCap{}. You {\bf were} \pTMN{}'s rising star. You were captain of the \pOld{}, one of the Navy's best strike ships and \cXO{} was your second in command. You'd gone through Officer's Academy together and kind of thought you could handle anything as long as you were together. But when the call to arms for went out, somehow the \pOld{} didn't receive it. It wasn't until hours later that the  missive came through on coms. By the time you jumped in, the battle was lost - or so any tactician would have said. But that was your home planet of \pHome{} below, so the \pOld{} went to battle stations and waded in. Your ship was out-matched; the move was suicide. But you had a secret weapon. You pulled a medallion from around your neck - an old family heirloom - and smashed it on the floor of the Bridge. Smoke poured from the broken bits of glass and metal, and a voice of something ancient and malevolent spoke to you. You begged for the power to turn the tide of battle and save your planet. The entity agreed, and vanished. The price would come clear in time.

The \pOld{} \emph{did} carry the day. You scrapped a miraculous win. Despite this, your superiors were obligated to issue a dishonorable discharge for your failure to answer the summons in a timely manner. You spiraled out for a while - your family had been in the Navy for generations. Your Mother, her father, his mother, numerous aunts and uncles\ldots you get the picture. You drifted from station to station, directionless. One night you got into a fight over a game of cards, and the cheating bastard drew a knife. If it weren't for \cSci{} and \cMed{}, you might have died in that back room. \cSci{}, another player at the table joined the fight, but it was not particularly clear who's side \cSci{\They} was on. The bastard with a knife got one good cut down your side before the barkeep broke the fight up - you might have died of blood loss but \cMed{} patched you up, whether you deserved it or not. You owe \cMed{} and possibly \cSci{} your life.

A brush with death like that will knock some sense into even the stubbornest \cCap{\human}. You began to pick up the pieces of your life. You reached out to \cXO{}, who had told you when you were discharged that if you ever needed anything\ldots You'd never command another military ship, but plenty of merchant craft needed captains. \cXO{} helped you secure one, the \pNew{}, and then to your amazement, quit their position in the Navy, and came to serve on your crew. \cMed{} and \cSci{}, who you'd been keeping in touch with were also surprisingly happy to leave their station-side posts to join up. If your grandfather was still talking to you, he'd tell you that it was a sign of your leadership. The rest of the crew of the \pNew{} assembled in bits and pieces, but now you've got a full complement and a couple of months experience working together. Things are looking up.

The dreams started the night after the battle of the \pOld{}. Your dreams are haunted by ghosts who scream and cry in pain; ghosts from ships on your side, and from the other side, from that fateful battle. This is the price you pay for your miracle.
