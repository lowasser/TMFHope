Went to space a while ago; found tech on mars that led quickly to the Jump drives. Jumps are safe and common. Humanity has found a rare few caches of tech like the one on mars. 

As humanity expanded to the stars, a rift grew between \pPlan{} and \pEdge{} that ultimately led to a war. \pEdge{} wanted to drive ever deeper into space, heedless of caution or cost. As long as exploration was exponential, and there was enough new, inhabitable, planets were found, and of course they didn't encounter anything \emph{dangerous}, their economic plan would theoretically work. The \pPlan{} were more conservative, and wished to have a slower, more cautions exploration, expanding only when humanity needed it. The war was hot and fast, with \pEdge{} making a series of tactical strikes on key \pPlan{} planets. Over \pHome{}, the planet where the constitutional monarchy of \pPlan{} was based, \pPlan{} were forced into a desperate last stand. At first it looked like \pEdge{} would prevail, but at the last possible second, the \pOld{} jumped in. Against all odds, this single strike ship turned the tide of \pBattle{} and snatched an impossible victory for \pPlan{}. The morale boost from that single miracle was enough to carry \pPlan{} to victory against \pEdge{}.

Ship are classified as either \pTMN{} (or TMN) for military or \pTMF{} (TMF) for civilian ships.

There are no signs of other civilizations traveling the stars now, but humanity maintains hope. Every ship in \pTMF{} is obligated to have a diplomat on crew, just in case the ship makes first contact with a new species.
