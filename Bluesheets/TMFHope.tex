The \pNew{} is a reliable, unglamorous, merchant ship. She makes her living shuttling raw materials from supply planets to industrial ones, and finished goods back again. She isn't the newest ship on the line, but she is reliable. Her Captain is \cCap{}, an experienced Navy Captain. This is \cCap{\their} first civilian ship after a dishonorable discharge from the Navy.  

The Captain's discharge was contentious, as \cCap{} was Captain of the \pOld{} in \pBattle{}. Technically the \pOld{} saved the day, and indeed the \pPlan{}, but her Captain was hours late in answering the summons. Six years after that battle, a few armchair tacticians still debate whether \pPlan{} had a chance at \pHome{} without whatever miracle the \pOld{} managed. What if the \pOld{} had arrived on time, but had the same odds as any other strike ship of surviving and taking out her target? In polite company those people are usually hushed before they can bring the thought to it's logical conclusion.

The ship's Executive Officer (XO), \cXO{} served with \cCap{}, but kept their job despite the fiasco at \pBattle{} as they were not in command. The rest of the crew of the \pNew{} have mild histories by comparison. The crew has all been working together for a few months, except for \cBoy{}, who was taken aboard at the last port the \pNew{} made.

All ships, including those in \pTMF{}, has a chain of command to maintain order. The hierarchy matters primarily in determining who is the acting captain if one or more crew members are unfit for command, or if the Captain is on an away mission for some reason.

{\bf The \pNew{} Chain of Command:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Captain: \cCap{}
	\item The Executive Officer: \cXO{}
	\item The Diplomat: \cDip{} - In a First Contact situation, the Diplomat is the highest authority and outranks even the Captain.
	\item The Doctor: \cMed{} - In medical emergencies the Doctor is the highest authority and outranks even the Captain.
	\item The Engineer: \cEng{}
	\item The Weapons Officer: \cWeap{}
	\item The Navigator: \cNav{}
	\item The Science Officer: \cSci{}
\end{enumerate}

\cBoy{} is not considered part of the chain of command, but if \cBoy{\they} were to be the last crew member capable of issuing orders on the \pNew{}, \cBoy{\them} could do so and carry those orders out \cBoy{\themself}.

The current predicament of the \pNew{} began
